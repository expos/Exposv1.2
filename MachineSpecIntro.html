<h2> Introduction </h2>

	<p>
	A detailed operating system specification was done in the work of [KAG+11]. This documentation was critically reviewed and modifications were done in many places to comply with our new design.
	The major modifications done are the following:
	<ol>
	<li> Addition of 8 Kernel registers and 4 Temporary registers.

	<li> The ready queue data structure in the previous design was replaced with a ready list data structure for simplicity in design and implementation.

	<li> The maximum number of processes supported by the Operating System was reduced to 12 from 16 due to space constraints in memory.

	<li> Interrupt specifications were modified due to the size constratits of interrupt code.

	<li> The memory layout was modified to incorporate the new design decisions.
	</ol>
	</p>

<h2>Brief Machine Description</h2>

	<p>The machine simulator is known as Extended Simple Integer Machine (ESIM).
	It is an interrupt driven uniprocessor machine.

	</div>
	The various components of the machine are :
	<ol>
		<li> <b>Disk</b> It is a non-volatile storage that stores user programs (executables) and data files.
		<li> <b>Memory</b> It is a volatile storage that stores the programs to be run on the machine as well as the operating system that manages the various programs.
		<li> <b>Processor</b> It is the main computational unit that is used to execute the instructions.
		<li> <b>Timer</b> It is a device that interrupts the processor after a pre-defined specific time interval.
		<li> <b>Load/Store</b> It is a macro that performs the functionalities of <em>DMA controller</em>
	</ol>
	</p>
<h2>Data types</h2>
	<p>
	The fundamental types supported by the machine are <i>integer</i> and <i>string</i>.
	A string is a sequence of characters terminated by '\0'. The machine interprets a single character also as a string.
	<p>
		The character 's' is stored as "s\0" in the memory and the word "ESIM" is stored as "ESIM\0" in the memory.
	</p>
	ESIM supports a maximum string length of <em>16</em>.
